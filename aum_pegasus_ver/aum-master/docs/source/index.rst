===============================

AUM: A Unified Modelling scheme for galaxy abundance, galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing.               
               
This piece of software has general purpose routines that allow prediction
of the galaxy abundances, their clustering and the galaxy-galaxy lensing
signal, given the halo occupation distribution of galaxies and the
underlying cosmological model.
